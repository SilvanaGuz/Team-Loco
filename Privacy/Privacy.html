        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
        <time datetime="2022-10-11">Last updated: October 11, 2022</time>
            <h2>1. OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>This is the Privacy Policy of Vimeo.com, Inc.
                <span>(“Vimeo”)</span>. Vimeo provides an online platform
                (the <span>“Vimeo OTT Service”</span> or “<span>Our service”</span>) that allows video content owners and licensors 
                (each a <span>“Producer”</span>) to offer their video programming to consumers
                via Producer-branded websites and applications (each set of Producer-branded 
                sites and apps, a <span>“Producer Channel”</span>).
            </p>

            <p><span>Consumers:</span> In order to access a Producer Channel, a consumer
                <span>(“you”)</span> must create an account with the applicable Producer. 
                By creating an account, you agree to provide certain personal information to 
                the Producer and Vimeo. When Vimeo collects, stores and processes that 
                information, it does so solely on behalf of the applicable Producer and 
                at its direction to, among other things, allow the Producer to provide 
                you with the applicable Producer Channel. In general, Vimeo serves as a 
                “processor” to the Producer and the Producer is the “controller” of your 
                information (as the terms “controller” and “processor”) are defined in the 
                EU General Data Protection Regulation <span>(“GDPR”)</span>.
            </p>
            
            <p><span>Producers:</span> This Privacy Policy does not apply to Producers.
                Instead, the Vimeo Privacy Policy available at <a href="https://vimeo.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/privacy</a> applies to Producers.
            </p>

            <p><span>Acceptance:</span> By using our service, including any Producer 
                Channel, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your 
                information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may modify this 
                Privacy Policy from time to time. Your continued use of our services 
                constitutes your agreement to any updated Privacy Policy on a 
                prospective basis.
            </p>

        <h2>2. ACCOUNT SECURITY</h2>
            <p>We use security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent disruptions or unauthorized access from occurring.</p>
            <p>You are solely responsible for (a) maintaining the security of your account(s) and (b) all activity that occurs under your account(s). You must notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to or use of your account(s). If you forget your account login information, you may request that we send it to the email address associated with your account(s).</p>
            
                <h2>3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

        <h2>4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES AND THIRD-PARTY DATA COLLECTION</h2>
            <p><span>Tracking Technologies: </span>Producers use standard tracking technologies such as pixels and cookies to track user activity on each Producer Channel. For more information about cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
            <p><span>Third-Party Platforms: </span>When you use an application that runs on a third-party platform (e.g., iOS, Roku, etc.), the provider of that third-party platform may collect information about you and your use of our application.</p>
            <p><span>Analytics and Advertising: </span>We use third-party analytics services to collect data about usage of our services. A Producer may allow third-party advertising companies (including advertising agencies, networks, and delivery vendors) to collect data regarding advertisements that they may place on our websites. Third-party analytics providers and advertising companies may use cookies to track your activities.</p>

        <h2>5. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>Vimeo and/or the relevant Producer may use the information collected about you to:</p>

                <li>Otherwise operate our business.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>6. DISCLOSURES TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>
            <p>Vimeo and/or the relevant Producer may disclose information about you as follows:</p>
            <p><span>Authorized Service Providers:</span> We may disclose your information to service providers involved in operating the Vimeo OTT Service. This includes payment providers, email service providers, content delivery networks, cloud storage providers, analytics companies, and professionals such as accountants and lawyers.</p>
            <p><span>Legal Situations:</span> We may disclose your information when we believe in good faith that (i) disclosure is required by a search warrant, subpoena (whether criminal or civil), civil investigative demand, court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; (ii) disclosure is appropriate and necessary to report a suspected crime (including any case of suspected child exploitation) or prevent physical harm to an individual or property; (iii) disclosure is appropriate and necessary to enforce our rights; and (iv) disclosure is required by law. Nothing in this Privacy Policy shall be deemed to create any third-party right, and we reserve the right to object to any third-party requests for information in appropriate circumstances.</p>
            <p><span>Affiliates and Corporate Transactions:</span> We may disclose your information to our parent companies in connection with operating our business. In the event Vimeo or its parent companies are involved in a business transition that involves the sale, merger, or divestment of Vimeo or its parent companies, we may disclose any information about you to the acquiring entities. The transferred information will remain subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, as updated.</p>
            <p><span>To the Public:</span> We may publicly disclose aggregated user statistics and other information, which is not considered personal information.</p>

        <h2>7. EMAILS</h2>
            <p>When you create an account, you may receive certain emails:</p>
            <p><span>Transaction emails:</span> When you first create an account, we may send you a welcome email that provides information about your subscription and your account. If you make a purchase, we may send you an email confirming your purchase. We may also, from time to time, send you other emails concerning your account status. You may not opt out of receiving transactional emails.</p>
            <p><span>Emails from Producers:</span>  When you purchase a subscription, you may agree to receive emails from the Producer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Producers may, via the Vimeo OTT Service, send emails concerning the availability of new video programming in a subscription that you have purchased. If you decide you no longer wish to receive these emails, you may opt out as instructed in each email</li>
                <li>Some Producers may email you directly (i.e., through non-Vimeo systems). Vimeo does not control these emails and opting out of Vimeo-sent emails will not cause an opt-out with respect to these emails. To opt out of emails sent directly by Producers, please follow the opt-out instructions set forth in the Producers’ emails.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>8. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
            <p>You may change your account information or close your account(s) at any time by logging into your account and selecting account settings. If you close an account, you may lose access to video programming that you have purchased. We may preserve your account information (i) for a period of time in case of accidental deletion or in case you change your mind; and (ii) where we believe in good faith that preservation is required by law or necessary to enforce our rights.</p>
            <p>The following rights apply only to the extent the relevant Producer is subject to the GDPR (for EEA users) and/or the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (the <span>“CCPA”</span>) (for California users).</p>

            <h3>EEA Users:</h3>
            <p>Users from the EEA have the right to: opt out of cookies (see our Cookie Policy); access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of their personal data; be forgotten; and data portability. For the most part, we enable exercise of these rights directly through the Vimeo OTT Service.</p>
            <p>If you require assistance or have a specific request that is not presently covered by our product features, please contact our Data Protection Officer. We may require additional information from you to fulfil your requests. We may charge a reasonable fee if your request imposes an unreasonable cost. We will afford UK-based users with all rights available to EU users, regardless of the UK’s EU member status.</p>
            
            <h3>California Users:</h3>
            <p><span>Users from California have the right to:</span> request information about the categories and sources of personal information collected about you, and the associated purposes for collection and third-party disclosures; request a copy of your personal information; request deletion of your personal information; and opt out of the sale of your personal information.</p>
            <p>To exercise your right to access or delete your personal information, we must be able to verify your identity as the owner of the account you are inquiring about. We may not be able to fulfill your request until we can do so. Although you do not need to have an OTT account to submit a request, we may not be able to locate certain information to process your request if you don’t have one.</p>

            <h3>Nevada Users:</h3>
            <p>Nevada residents have the right to opt out of the sale of certain "covered information" collected by operators of websites or online services. We currently do not sell covered information, as "sale" is defined by such law, and we don't have plans to sell this information.</p>

        <h2>9. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
            <p>Vimeo does not knowingly collect any personal information from individuals under the age of 16. If you are a parent or legal guardian who has discovered that your child has provided personal information through the Vimeo OTT Service without your consent, you can ask us to remove such unauthorized information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:OTTprivacy@vhx.tv">OTTprivacy@vhx.tv</a></p>

        <h2>10. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
            <p>We or a Producer may provide links to third-party websites and applications. We have no control over such services and therefore refer you to their privacy policies for information on their respective privacy practices.</p>

            <h3>hCaptcha:</h3>
            <p>We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge. Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy</a> and <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/terms" target="_blank">https://www.hcaptcha.com/terms.</a></p>

        <h2>11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
            <p>We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint. We encourage you to begin by contacting our Data Protection Officer. We endeavor to respond to requests promptly.</p>
            <p>E.U. residents have the right to lodge complaints with the data protection authority of their country of residence.</p>
